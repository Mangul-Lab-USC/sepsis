d25,GSM1548279,GDSGSE63042,Illumina Genome Analyzer II,Whole Blood Cells,"CAPSOD experimental samples were sequenced without multiplexing on Illumina GAIIx instruments (54-cycle singleton reads).This yielded 13.4 million reads, totaling 718.4 Mbp of sequence, and 9-fold average coverage. Base calling was performed using Illumina Pipeline software v1.4, except for 14 samples performed with v1.3. Approximately 500 million high quality reads were generated per sample.Sequence quality analysis was performed on the raw data using FastQC version 0.10.1, assessing per-base and overall sequence quality, nucleotide composition, and uncalled bases. Quality trimming and adapter clipping were performed using Trimmomatic version 0.32, trimming trailing bases below Phred quality score of 20 (which corresponds to a 99% base call accuracy rate), and discarding clipped reads shorter than 25 bp. FastQC was used to re-assess the integrity of the clipped reads prior to subsequent mapping and analysis. On average, over 93% of the sequences had a mean Phred base call quality of 20 or higher after trimming. The post-trimming uncalled base rate was 0.09%.Clipped reads were mapped to the hg19 genome using Tophat version 2.0.7, and assembled with Cufflinks version 2.0.2, all with default parameter settings. The average mapping rate was 77.7%. Read counts for each gene were obtained with HTSeq version 0.5.4, specifically the intersection-nonempty mode of htseq-count. SAM/BAM conversions, sorting, indexing, and marking of PCR duplicates were performed with SAMtools version 0.1.18 and Picard version 1.83.For variant analysis, sequence data were aligned to the GRCh37.p5 human reference genome using STAR. Read alignments were processed with the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) version 3.1. Duplicate reads were removed and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) discovery and genotyping was performed on all samples individually using the GATK HaplotypeCaller producing a standard variant call format (VCF) . Resulting nuclear variants were hard filtered to keep variants with a Phred scaled quality score of 20 or higher (a measure of quality of DNA sequence). To address issues with varying coverage in the mitochondrial genome, samples were filtered so that only 91 samples with at least 85% of the mitochondrial genome covered by 16 reads or more were included in the final variant analysis. Further, mitochondrial variants were only analyzed if they were identified in 10 reads or more.Variants were annotated with the Rapid Understanding of Nucleotide variant Effect Software (RUNES v1.0). RUNES incorporates data from ENSEMBL’s Variant Effect Predictor software, and produces comparisons to NCBI dbSNP, known disease mutations from the Human Gene Mutation Database , and performs additional in silico prediction of variant consequences using RefSeq and ENSEMBL gene annotations.

Read alignments were processed with the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) version 3.1. Duplicate reads were removed and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) discovery and genotyping was performed on all samples individually using the GATK HaplotypeCaller producing a standard variant call format (VCF) . Resulting nuclear variants were hard filtered to keep variants with a Phred scaled quality score of 20 or higher (a measure of quality of DNA sequence). To address issues with varying coverage in the mitochondrial genome, samples were filtered so that only 91 samples with at least 85% of the mitochondrial genome covered by 16 reads or more were included in the final variant analysis. Further, mitochondrial variants were only analyzed if they were identified in 10 reads or more.Variants were annotated with the Rapid Understanding of Nucleotide variant Effect Software (RUNES v1.0).

Quality trimming and adapter clipping were performed using Trimmomatic version 0.32, trimming trailing bases below Phred quality score of 20 (which corresponds to a 99% base call accuracy rate), and discarding clipped reads shorter than 25 bp. FastQC was used to re-assess the integrity of the clipped reads prior to subsequent mapping and analysis. On average, over 93% of the sequences had a mean Phred base call quality of 20 or higher after trimming. The post-trimming uncalled base rate was 0.09%.Clipped reads were mapped to the hg19 genome using Tophat version 2.0.7, and assembled with Cufflinks version 2.0.2, all with default parameter settings. The average mapping rate was 77.7%. Read counts for each gene were obtained with HTSeq version 0.5.4, specifically the intersection-nonempty mode of htseq-count. SAM/BAM conversions, sorting, indexing, and marking of PCR duplicates were performed with SAMtools version 0.1.18 and Picard version 1.83.For variant analysis, sequence data were aligned to the GRCh37.p5 human reference genome using STAR. Read alignments were processed with the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) version 3.1. Duplicate reads were removed and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) discovery and genotyping was performed on all samples individually using the GATK HaplotypeCaller producing a standard variant call format (VCF) . Resulting nuclear variants were hard filtered to keep variants with a Phred scaled quality score of 20 or higher (a measure of quality of DNA sequence). To address issues with varying coverage in the mitochondrial genome, samples were filtered so that only 91 samples with at least 85% of the mitochondrial genome covered by 16 reads or more were included in the final variant analysis. Further, mitochondrial variants were only analyzed if they were identified in 10 reads or more.Variants were annotated with the Rapid Understanding of Nucleotide variant Effect Software (RUNES v1.0). RUNES incorporates data from ENSEMBL’s Variant Effect Predictor software, and produces comparisons to NCBI dbSNP, known disease mutations from the Human Gene Mutation Database , and performs additional in silico prediction of variant consequences using RefSeq and ENSEMBL gene annotations.

Quality trimming and adapter clipping were performed using Trimmomatic version 0.32, trimming trailing bases below Phred quality score of 20 (which corresponds to a 99% base call accuracy rate), and discarding clipped reads shorter than 25 bp. FastQC was used to re-assess the integrity of the clipped reads prior to subsequent mapping and analysis. On average, over 93% of the sequences had a mean Phred base call quality of 20 or higher after trimming. The post-trimming uncalled base rate was 0.09%.Clipped reads were mapped to the hg19 genome using Tophat version 2.0.7, and assembled with Cufflinks version 2.0.2, all with default parameter settings. The average mapping rate was 77.7%. Read counts for each gene were obtained with HTSeq version 0.5.4, specifically the intersection-nonempty mode of htseq-count. SAM/BAM conversions, sorting, indexing, and marking of PCR duplicates were performed with SAMtools version 0.1.18 and Picard version 1.83.For variant analysis, sequence data were aligned to the GRCh37.p5 human reference genome using STAR. Read alignments were processed with the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) version 3.1. Duplicate reads were removed and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) discovery and genotyping was performed on all samples individually using the GATK HaplotypeCaller producing a standard variant call format (VCF) . Resulting nuclear variants were hard filtered to keep variants with a Phred scaled quality score of 20 or higher (a measure of quality of DNA sequence). To address issues with varying coverage in the mitochondrial genome, samples were filtered so that only 91 samples with at least 85% of the mitochondrial genome covered by 16 reads or more were included in the final variant analysis. Further, mitochondrial variants were only analyzed if they were identified in 10 reads or more.Variants were annotated with the Rapid Understanding of Nucleotide variant Effect Software (RUNES v1.0). RUNES incorporates data from ENSEMBL’s Variant Effect Predictor software, and produces comparisons to NCBI dbSNP, known disease mutations from the Human Gene Mutation Database , and performs additional in silico prediction of variant consequences using RefSeq and ENSEMBL gene annotations.

Quality trimming and adapter clipping were performed using Trimmomatic version 0.32, trimming trailing bases below Phred quality score of 20 (which corresponds to a 99% base call accuracy rate), and discarding clipped reads shorter than 25 bp. FastQC was used to re-assess the integrity of the clipped reads prior to subsequent mapping and analysis. On average, over 93% of the sequences had a mean Phred base call quality of 20 or higher after trimming. The post-trimming uncalled base rate was 0.09%.Clipped reads were mapped to the hg19 genome using Tophat version 2.0.7, and assembled with Cufflinks version 2.0.2, all with default parameter settings. The average mapping rate was 77.7%. Read counts for each gene were obtained with HTSeq version 0.5.4, specifically the intersection-nonempty mode of htseq-count. SAM/BAM conversions, sorting, indexing, and marking of PCR duplicates were performed with SAMtools version 0.1.18 and Picard version 1.83.For variant analysis, sequence data were aligned to the GRCh37.p5 human reference genome using STAR. Read alignments were processed with the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) version 3.1. Duplicate reads were removed and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) discovery and genotyping was performed on all samples individually using the GATK HaplotypeCaller producing a standard variant call format (VCF) . Resulting nuclear variants were hard filtered to keep variants with a Phred scaled quality score of 20 or higher (a measure of quality of DNA sequence). To address issues with varying coverage in the mitochondrial genome, samples were filtered so that only 91 samples with at least 85% of the mitochondrial genome covered by 16 reads or more were included in the final variant analysis. Further, mitochondrial variants were only analyzed if they were identified in 10 reads or more.Variants were annotated with the Rapid Understanding of Nucleotide variant Effect Software (RUNES v1.0). RUNES incorporates data from ENSEMBL’s Variant Effect Predictor software, and produces comparisons to NCBI dbSNP, known disease mutations from the Human Gene Mutation Database , and performs additional in silico prediction of variant consequences using RefSeq and ENSEMBL gene annotations.

Quality trimming and adapter clipping were performed using Trimmomatic version 0.32, trimming trailing bases below Phred quality score of 20 (which corresponds to a 99% base call accuracy rate), and discarding clipped reads shorter than 25 bp. FastQC was used to re-assess the integrity of the clipped reads prior to subsequent mapping and analysis. On average, over 93% of the sequences had a mean Phred base call quality of 20 or higher after trimming. The post-trimming uncalled base rate was 0.09%.Clipped reads were mapped to the hg19 genome using Tophat version 2.0.7, and assembled with Cufflinks version 2.0.2, all with default parameter settings. The average mapping rate was 77.7%. Read counts for each gene were obtained with HTSeq version 0.5.4, specifically the intersection-nonempty mode of htseq-count. SAM/BAM conversions, sorting, indexing, and marking of PCR duplicates were performed with SAMtools version 0.1.18 and Picard version 1.83.For variant analysis, sequence data were aligned to the GRCh37.p5 human reference genome using STAR. Read alignments were processed with the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) version 3.1. Duplicate reads were removed and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) discovery and genotyping was performed on all samples individually using the GATK HaplotypeCaller producing a standard variant call format (VCF) . Resulting nuclear variants were hard filtered to keep variants with a Phred scaled quality score of 20 or higher (a measure of quality of DNA sequence). To address issues with varying coverage in the mitochondrial genome, samples were filtered so that only 91 samples with at least 85% of the mitochondrial genome covered by 16 reads or more were included in the final variant analysis. Further, mitochondrial variants were only analyzed if they were identified in 10 reads or more.Variants were annotated with the Rapid Understanding of Nucleotide variant Effect Software (RUNES v1.0). RUNES incorporates data from ENSEMBL’s Variant Effect Predictor software, and produces comparisons to NCBI dbSNP, known disease mutations from the Human Gene Mutation Database , and performs additional in silico prediction of variant consequences using RefSeq and ENSEMBL gene annotations.

Quality trimming and adapter clipping were performed using Trimmomatic version 0.32, trimming trailing bases below Phred quality score of 20 (which corresponds to a 99% base call accuracy rate), and discarding clipped reads shorter than 25 bp. FastQC was used to re-assess the integrity of the clipped reads prior to subsequent mapping and analysis. On average, over 93% of the sequences had a mean Phred base call quality of 20 or higher after trimming. The post-trimming uncalled base rate was 0.09%.Clipped reads were mapped to the hg19 genome using Tophat version 2.0.7, and assembled with Cufflinks version 2.0.2, all with default parameter settings. The average mapping rate was 77.7%. Read counts for each gene were obtained with HTSeq version 0.5.4, specifically the intersection-nonempty mode of htseq-count. SAM/BAM conversions, sorting, indexing, and marking of PCR duplicates were performed with SAMtools version 0.1.18 and Picard version 1.83.For variant analysis, sequence data were aligned to the GRCh37.p5 human reference genome using STAR. Read alignments were processed with the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) version 3.1. Duplicate reads were removed and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and insertion/deletion (INDEL) discovery and genotyping was performed on all samples individually using the GATK HaplotypeCaller producing a standard variant call format (VCF) . Resulting nuclear variants were hard filtered to keep variants with a Phred scaled quality score of 20 or higher (a measure of quality of DNA sequence). To address issues with varying coverage in the mitochondrial genome, samples were filtered so that only 91 samples with at least 85% of the mitochondrial genome covered by 16 reads or more were included in the final variant analysis. Further, mitochondrial variants were only analyzed if they were identified in 10 reads or more.Variants were annotated with the Rapid Understanding of Nucleotide variant Effect Software (RUNES v1.0). RUNES incorporates data from ENSEMBL’s Variant Effect Predictor software, and produces comparisons to NCBI dbSNP, known disease mutations from the Human Gene Mutation Database , and performs additional in silico prediction of variant consequences using RefSeq and ENSEMBL gene annotations.

To address issues with varying coverage in the mitochondrial genome, samples were filtered so that only 91 samples with at least 85% of the mitochondrial genome covered by 16 reads or more were included in the final variant analysis. Further, mitochondrial variants were only analyzed if they were identified in 10 reads or more.Variants were annotated with the Rapid Understanding of Nucleotide variant Effect Software (RUNES v1.0). RUNES incorporates data from ENSEMBL’s Variant Effect Predictor software, and produces comparisons to NCBI dbSNP, known disease mutations from the Human Gene Mutation Database , and performs additional in silico prediction of variant consequences using RefSeq and ENSEMBL gene annotations. RUNES categorizes each variant according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for reporting sequence variation as well as an allele frequency derived from the Children’s Mercy Hospital Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine Variant Warehouse database.Genome_build: The Illumina iGenomes UCSC hg19 human reference genome and annotation was used as a reference, downloaded March 2013Supplementary_files_format_and_content: mRNA sequencing for 129 subjects to an average depth of 13.5 million reads/sample yielded relative levels of transcription of 30,792 genes (of which 18,078 mRNAs were detected in >50% of subjects).

hf348,GSM1548356,GDSGSE63042,Illumina Genome Analyzer II,Whole Blood Cells,"CAPSOD experimental samples were sequenced without multiplexing on Illumina GAIIx instruments (54-cycle singleton reads).This yielded 13.4 million reads, totaling 718.4 Mbp of sequence, and 9-fold average coverage. Base calling was performed using Illumina Pipeline software v1.4, except for 14 samples performed with v1.3. Approximately 500 million high quality reads were generated per sample.Sequence quality analysis was performed on the raw data using FastQC version 0.10.1, assessing per-base and overall sequence quality, nucleotide composition, and uncalled bases. Quality trimming and adapter clipping were performed using Trimmomatic version 0.32, trimming trailing bases below Phred quality score of 20 (which corresponds to a 99% base call accuracy rate), and discarding clipped reads shorter than 25 bp. FastQC was used to re-assess the integrity of the clipped reads prior to subsequent mapping and analysis. On average, over 93% of the sequences had a mean Phred base call quality of 20 or higher after trimming. The post-trimming uncalled base rate was 0.09%.Clipped reads were mapped to the hg19 genome using Tophat version 2.0.7, and assembled with Cufflinks version 2.0.2, all with default parameter settings. The average mapping rate was 77.7%. Read counts for each gene were obtained with HTSeq version 0.5.4, specifically the intersection-nonempty mode of htseq-count. SAM/BAM conversions, sorting, indexing, and marking of PCR duplicates were performed with SAMtools version 0.1.18 and Picard version 1.83.For variant analysis, sequence data were aligned to the GRCh37.p5 human reference genome using STAR. Read alignments were processed with the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATK) version 3.1.
